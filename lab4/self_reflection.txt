All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: Making a private method for relocating nextFirst and nextLast would make my code less bulky and easier for people to read.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Having it under 130 lines of code.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Repetition. I repeated a lot of equations that I could have made into private methods.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: I wish I had known about the function of modulus in the beginning because my first proj1A used a lot of if and else statements instead.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: If I wrote ArrayDequq again, I would create more private methods to make the code more elegant and concise.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: In my code I left IntNode the same name when I should have followed the staff solution and changed it's name to represent how it can take in any generic variable.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Figuring out how to accurately and efficiently use Sentinel nodes to create a working double ended linked list.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Because the names for my variables were relatively long, my lines would sometimes be a bit long to read.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: I wish I had known how easier it would be to do a circular LinkedList instead of a double ended one that I did.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would rename my variables so that they would take up less space.

Meta:

Q: This is the first time we've tried something like this. Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: This review process was nice, but I would have liked it more if I had the option to do it on my own time with friends instead of being forced to come to lab section. But this review session was very informative and made me relook at old code I never wanted to see again so I could learn from my mistakes.
